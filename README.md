# Kotlin journey

Learning a new language is always a journey. This is our experience at **Mobile Jazz** as we explore this promising language.

In every package, with the same name as the index, you will find markdown files with notes and code sample about it. 

## Index

- [Basics](src/main/kotlin/com/mobilejazz/kotlin/basics/basics.md)
- Classes and objects
